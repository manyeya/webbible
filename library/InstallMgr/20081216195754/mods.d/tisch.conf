Description=Tischendorf's Eighth Edition GNT
About=The Greek Text corresponds to the printed text found in:\par Tischendorf, Constantinus, Novum Testamentum Graece, editio octava critica major Vol. I, 1869; Vol. II 1872, Leipzig:Giesecke and Devrient. Vol 3, Prolegomena, ed. by Caspar Rene' Gregory, Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1894.\par The text contains no accents or diacritical marks.  This text was prepared from the Westcott-Hort-Nestle Aland text found in the Greek text prepared by Dr. Maurice Robinson. Available FTP: ftp://:@archimedes.nosc.mil:21/pub/gnt/ File whn26.zip. The text was compared to the printed edition of Tischendorf's. Changes were made in the text to make it correspond to the printed edition. The text was proofed against the Tischendorf text.\par The present plan is to scan in, key in corrections and proof the complete critical apparatus of Tischendorf's. The apparatus will then be in text format available to any one who would like to use it for research or incorporate it into a Bible software program. I have been informed that this is not an easy task. I am very aware of the complexity of the text and the pitfalls of such a colossal undertaking.  The apparatus will be released as each book is completed.\par According to J. Harold Greenlee "His 'eighth major edition' (1869-72) contains a critical apparatus which has never been equaled in comprehensiveness of citation of Greek mss., versions, and patristic evidence. A century later it is still indispensable for serious work in the text of the N.T."\par The Greek and Hebrew words are being tagged using the scheme found in the Online Bible program. The transliteration scheme will allow it to be read by the Online Bible program.\par The Greek text is released as a public domain text.\par If any errors are found in this text please let me know as soon as possible.\par\par Clint Yale\par 1014 West Smith Road #26\par Bellingham, WA 98226\par 360-384-1015\par ccr3yale@telcomplus.com
