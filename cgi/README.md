webbible CGI
========
Must first install ( from source ) Crosewires sword api, Then the compile.sh will work

Then place vrp.cgi in /usr/lib/cgi-bin ( or what ever is your current cgi bin )

Copy library to /usr/lib/library ( or the parrent directory of cgi-bin )

modules.cgi is not currently working as a cgi file, so I just run it and pipe the output to modules.json in the root directory


This is a web based project that's aim it to offer full featured bible study tool that is web based.

A Special thanks to [CrossWire]( http://www.crosswire.org/index.jsp ) For there sword api which is the basis the back end
